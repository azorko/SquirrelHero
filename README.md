###Squirrel Hero

The evil Dr. Zonko has brewed up a plan to take over the world with a throng of mad cow minions! He has engineered a ZONKO-COWCAPTURE contraption that attaches "self-maneuvering" ZONKO-BALLOONAWAY gadgets to any cow it captures. Zonko has ruthlessly set up his ZONKO-COWCAPTUREs in the peaceful Elwynn Forest and is planning to fly all the cows to his secret laboratory and turn them into mad cow minions.

Only Squirrel Hero can save Elwynn Forest now! Hero has discovered a weakness in Zonko's plan. Contrary to the high tech nature of the ZONKO-BALLOONAWAYs, these gadgets are made of 99% latex and are easily penetrable! Armed with his trusty acorn shooters he can pop the ZONKO-BALLOONAWAYs and set the cows free.

Help Squirrel Hero save the world one cow at a time!
